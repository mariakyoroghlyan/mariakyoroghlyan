## 🧠 About Me

I'm a full-stack developer who thrives on turning complex problems into elegant solutions.  
Whether it's crafting clean UIs or building powerful backend systems — I enjoy working across the stack.  
Currently, I work with PHP (CodeIgniter), React, and Next.js, and I'm diving deeper into modern JavaScript and iOS development with Swift.
